# Determine When to Develop a DirectQuery Model

- Models are composed of tables.
- Intro:
  - DirectQuery model are tables whose storage mode is set to DirectQuery and belong to the same source group.
  - source group:
    - a set of model tables related to a single data source.
    - two types:
      - Import:
        - all _import storage mode_ tables including _calculated tables_.
        - Only able to have one import source group in a model.
      - DirectQuery:
        - all DirectQuery storage mode tables related to a specific data source.
  - composite models are made of multiple source groups.
- DirectQuery model benefits:
  - model large or fast-changing data sources:
    - dont require refresh
    - example of large volume is a data warehouse
  - Enforce Source RLS:
    - row-level security: RLS
    - allows the source to enforce its own RLS
    - only works for some databases
    - requires setting up single sign-on for the dataset data source.
  - data sovereignty restrictions:
    - some data sources do not allow data to be imported or removed from the source location. DirectQuery enables access of the data without copying.
  - Create specialized datasets:
    - can connect to Power BI dataset (or ASS model) and convert to DirectQuery local model
    - original dataset is considered remote
    - new dataset considered local.
    - can chain up to 3 models in this fashion.
    - A form of inheritance or interfacing
    - can extend the remote model by adding or modifying fields, tables, measures.
    - extensions result in the formation of a composite model.
- DirectQuery Model Limitations:
  - does not support all data sources:
    - only Major RDBMS, Power BI datasets, Azure Analysis Services models.
  - Not all Power Query (M) transformations are possible:
    - must be understood by source system
    - i.e. pivot/unpivot not possible.
  - Analytic queries can be slow if source systems are not optimized or resources are low.
  - analytic queries are heavy and can impact source system performance as a whole.
- Boost DirectQuery Model Performance:
  - data source optimizations:
  - indexing and materializing views.
- DirectQuery User-Defined Aggregation Tables:
  - User-defined aggregation tables:
    - can be added to a DirectQuery model.
    - special model table that are hidden.
    - they are hidden from users, calculations and RLS
    - best for satisfying higher-grain analytic queries over large fact tables.
    - if set to DirectQuery, can query materialized views in datasource.
    - can use import storage mode
    - can use automatic aggregations.
