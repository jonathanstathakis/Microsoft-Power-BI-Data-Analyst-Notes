# Determine When to Develop an Import Model

- intro:
  - an import model is a table whose storage mode = Import.
  - import models include calculated tables
  - calculated tables are defined with a DAX formula.
- Import model benefits:
  - most common model framewoek
  - default framework in Power BI
  - support all _Power BI Source Types_.
  - _Power BI Source Types_ include:
    - databases
    - files
    - feeds
    - web pages
    - dataflows
  - they are able to combine sources: related tables can source from different sources i.e. database, web page etc.
  - Support DAX and Power Query (M)
  - support calculated tables
  - has the best query performance:
    - data is cached
    - data is optimized for analytic queries
    - model is entirely in memory
    - analytic queries include: filter, group, summarize.
- Import Model Limitations:
  - model size:
    - published models are limited to 1GB (compressed)
    - premium capacities are allowed > 10GB.
    - important to reduce data in a model to only what is required.
    - data reduction techniques include:
      - remove superfluous columns/rows
      - group by and summarize to raise _grain_ of fact tables
      - optimize datatypes, preferencing numeric data.
      - disable Power Query query load
      - disable auto date/time
      - use DirectQuery table storage
  - data refresh:
    - imported data needs to be refreshed
    - can set up scheduled refreshes.
    - consumers can perform an on-demand refresh.
    - refreshing is limited:
      - 8 times per day in _shared capacity_
      - 48 times per day in _dedicated capacity_
    - if need more often, use:
      - DirectQuery
      - a hybrid table
      - use a real-time dataset.
    - incremental refresh:
      - refresh clears out all data and reloads it. This can be taxing
      - incremental refresh can be used to create and manage time-period partitions
      - can restrict refresh to the most time-sensitive partitions.
      - can customize a partitioning strategy
